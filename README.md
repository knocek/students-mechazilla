   Select the correct build configuration:
   Configuration: Debug or Release.
   Platform: x64.

3. **Set Up SFML**
   1. Navigate to the folder where you installed SFML.
   2. Copy the required .dll files from SFML/bin to the x64/Debug (or x64/Release) folder in your project directory:

  Debug:
  ~~~bash  
  sfml-graphics-d.dll
  sfml-window-d.dll
  sfml-system-d.dll
  sfml-audio-d.dll
  sfml-network-d.dll 
  ~~~~

  Release (no -d suffix):
  ~~~bash
  sfml-graphics.dll
  sfml-window.dll
  sfml-system.dll
  sfml-audio.dll
  sfml-network.dll
  ~~~

   3. Ensure the following SFML folders are properly configured in Visual Studio:

   Include Path: Add SFML/include to the project's include directories.
   Library Path: Add SFML/lib to the project's library directories.
   Dependencies: Link the following libraries in Visual Studio:
   ~~~bash
   sfml-graphics-d.lib
   sfml-window-d.lib
   sfml-system-d.lib
   sfml-audio-d.lib
   sfml-network-d.lib
   ~~~

## üîß Building and Running the Game
In Visual Studio, click Build ‚Üí Build Solution or press Ctrl+Shift+B.
After the build completes, find the executable file in:

Run the .exe file to start the game!


## üîß Troubleshooting
Problem: Missing .dll files
Ensure you copied the .dll files from SFML/bin to the appropriate output folder (x64/Debug or x64/Release).

Problem: Executable file not generated
Verify that the correct configuration (x64/Debug or x64/Release) is selected.
Ensure all SFML paths (include and lib) are properly set up in the project settings.
